# Aqua King Website

A exhibit of the code from a company's website that I designed and continue to maintain on their github.

Built using a combination of HTML, CSS, javascript and bootstrap. 
Designed to be modern, minimalist and simple to use.
Provides a clean interface to view the company's portfolio and information, as well as a contact form.

Website is live and running at www.aquakingpools.co.uk
